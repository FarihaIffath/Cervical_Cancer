# Cervical_Cancer

In recent days, Machine Learning Prediction Models can be used to  predict the result of Biopsy test and thereby confirming the presence/non-presence of cervical cancer in the patients.
There is more chance of survival if the cancer is detected during its early stages.
Therefore, the ML model should be helpful in predicting the cancer and thus it can be a huge asset to the medical industry.
 Our work is an attempt to improve the prediction performance by using ADASYN and Isolation Foreset algorithm, a
comparative insight of five ML techniques are also included here.
